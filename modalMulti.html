<!-- There are a few potential causes of the error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent')" that you provided:

The element you are trying to access does not exist in the DOM, meaning that the getElementById method is returning null.
The element you are trying to access exists in the DOM, but its textContent property is null or undefined.
Based on the code you provided, it seems like the error is most likely caused by the first scenario, where one of the elements you are trying to access does not exist in the DOM. Specifically, it looks like the document.getElementById method is returning null for one of the following lines:

javascript
Copy code
const winnerTitle = document.getElementById("winner_title");
const secondTitle = document.getElementById("second_title");
const thirdTitle = document.getElementById("third_title");
const lastTitle = document.getElementById("last_title");
To troubleshoot this error, you can try the following:

Double-check that the id attribute values for each of the elements you are trying to access are correct and match the values in your HTML markup.
Make sure that the elements you are trying to access have been added to the DOM before your JavaScript code runs. If the elements are added dynamically or asynchronously, you may need to use a different method to access them (such as querySelector).
Check that your JavaScript code is being executed after the elements have been added to the DOM. If your code is being executed before the elements are added, the getElementById method will not be able to find the elements and will return null.
If you are still having trouble, try adding some console.log statements to your code to help you track down which line is causing the error, and what values are being returned by each method call. -->
